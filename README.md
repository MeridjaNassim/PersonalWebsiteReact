This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# My Personal Website

This is my first Personal website created using ReactJS for the front-end . The design was inspired from the Template [Moha-Personal Website] (http://cvresumetemplate.com/maha-personal-cv-resume-html-template/home-one.html) . but was implemented entirely from scratch using ReactJS .
